The principle behind the International System of Units is to provide the same values for measurements such as length, 
	weight, and time no matter where in the world measurement is performed.
		Furthermore, by arbitrarily teaching a few non-SI units and ignoring the rest, we give students a false sense of understanding.
	For example, they don’t realize that a “pound” of force is entirely different from a “pound” of mass or a “pound” of pressure, 
	or that “ounces” of soft drink are volume units unrelated to “ounces” of mass...
		It's always good to have such a system handy# labs2
